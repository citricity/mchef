# Feature Requirements

This directory contains feature specifications and requirements for the Moodle Chef project.

## Purpose

- Document new features that need to be implemented
- Specify requirements and acceptance criteria
- Provide design specifications and user stories
- Track feature requests and enhancements

## File Format

Each feature should be documented in a separate Markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Description

Brief description of the feature

## Requirements

- List of specific requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications

## User Stories

- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

## Implementation Notes

- Technical considerations
- Dependencies
- Constraints

## Status

- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Completed
```

## Workflow

1. Create a new `.md` file for each feature unless it already exists
2. Each feature file should have a title and a subtitle of status. The status can be one of "not implemented", "in progress", "complete"
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `plugin-validation.md`, `docker-optimization.md`)
4. Include all necessary details for how to implement the requirement
5. Reference these files when implementing features
6. Update status of feature requirement to "in progress" when worked on, and to "complete" when a) the feature code exists b) there are unit tests c) the developer has told you the feature should be considered complete.
