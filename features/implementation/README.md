# Feature Implementation Documentation

This directory contains documentation for implemented features in the Moodle Chef project.

## Purpose

- Document how features were implemented
- Explain design decisions and architecture choices
- Provide usage examples and best practices
- Maintain a record of implementation details

## File Format

Each implementation should be documented in a Markdown file with the following structure:

````markdown
# Feature Implementation: [Feature Name]

## Overview

Brief description of what was implemented

## Implementation Details

- Architecture decisions
- Code organization
- Key classes/methods involved
- Design patterns used

## Code Examples

```php
// Example usage
```
````

## Testing

- Test strategies used
- Key test cases
- Coverage information

## Configuration

- Configuration options
- Default values
- Environment considerations

## Usage

- How to use the feature
- Command examples
- Common scenarios

## Future Considerations

- Potential improvements
- Known limitations
- Extension points

```

## Workflow

1. Create implementation documentation after completing features
2. Use descriptive filenames matching the requirement files
3. Include code examples and usage instructions
4. Update documentation when making changes to implemented features
5. Reference original requirement files for context
```
